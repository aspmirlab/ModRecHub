To mimic real-life propagation effects we simulated two different fading models, which include a Rician and a Rayleigh propagation effects. We also varied the white noise amplitude setting such that the signal constellations were created at -5dB to +20dB SNR range at a step of 5dB. We acquired 50 samples for each of the modulation schemes at each step to obtain a total of 3,600 samples for all the six schemes considered. The figures below show samples of constellation diagrams for the six modulation schemes with different SNRs.
