# ModRecHub
ModRecHub - An online hub for Datasets, Algorithms and Models on Modulation Recognition for Communication Systems

<h3>(1) ModRec_SimDataV1</h3>
The link below gives you access to the raw simulated dataset of six Modulation Schemes, namely - 16QAM, 64QAM, BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, and GMSK. All the modulation schemes were curated in the GNU Radio Companion.

To mimic real-life propagation effects we simulated two different fading models, which include a Rician and a Rayleigh propagation effects. We also varied the white noise amplitude setting such that the signal constellations were created at -5dB to +20dB SNR range at a step of 5dB. We acquired 50 samples for each of the modulation schemes at each step to obtain a total of 3,600 samples for all the six schemes considered.
